We are asked to integrate over the interval [0,1] instead but new values can be plugged into the derived values to update them to the appropriate ones. I looked at this discussion thread to see how to update the x-values and weights.

I read that the \"naive\" method of sampling randomly-uniformly from the domain can be improved upon. By looking at the function and drawing more samples from the area where the probability density function is concentrated you will converge faster towards the correct integral. This is for example made us of when rendering scenes with Monte Carlo ray tracing."
